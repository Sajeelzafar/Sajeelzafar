Hello everyone, I’m currently pursuing my dream of becoming a Full-Stack developer at Microverse by coding 8 hours a day with other developers.
This helped me develop discipline and skills to work in a coordinative environment. Some of the technologies I love getting involved with include:

ReactJS, Javascript, APIs, Ruby, Rails, HTML5 and CSS.
I am looking forward to working with a high-tech company and am proud to take small continuous steps to achieve the ultimate goal.
